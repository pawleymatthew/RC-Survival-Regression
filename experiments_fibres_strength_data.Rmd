# Experiments: Fibres Strength Data

The following data is from Table 4.1 in Statistical Analysis of Reliability Data by Crowder et al. 

It shows the failure stresses (in GPa) of single carbon fibres of four different lengths (in mm).

```{r}
fibre_stress_df <- read.csv(file = 'fibres_failure_stress.csv', header = TRUE)
kable(head(fibre_stress_df ))
```
