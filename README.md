# RC-Survival-Regression

Reading Course project on 'Regression Models for Time-to-Event Data' supervised by Karim Anaya-Izquierdo (Semester 1, 2020-21).

* The PDF file contains the project report. 
* The Rmd file contains all the code from this project and generates all the results used in the report. 
* The HTML file is a pre-compiled version of the Rmd file. Moreover, it contains the results of the 'Testing the effect of the censoring mechanism' section, which is not run in the Rmd file because it takes a while. 
* The CSV file contains the fibres data.
* The figs folder contains PDF files of all the figures from the report.
